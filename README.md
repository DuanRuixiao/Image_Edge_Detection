# Image Edge Detection

## Report

Completed report is under "reports" folder.

## Introduction

* Studied edge detection algorithms: gradient, Laplacian and Canny detection algorithms.
* Implemented Sobel, Prewitt, Roberts, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) and Canny edge detectors in MATLAB.
* Trained dataset and compared with true labels to find proper hyperparameters.
* Tested detectors with test dataset and evaluated their performance.
* Made comparison with different detectors and try to explain reasons.
